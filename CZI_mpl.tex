\title{Matplotlib - Foundation of Visualization in Python}
\author{}
\maketitle


The purpose of this proposal is to enable Matplotlib to continue
serving as the primary plotting library of the scientific Python
ecosystem.  We will respond to the backlog of Issues and Pull
Requests and plan Matplotlib's evolution to meet the challenges
of the coming decade.

By most measures Matplotlib is a wildly successful project.  The
source has been actively developed and maintained by a vibrant
community over the last 16 years.  Conservatively, we have 1M monthly
users across the wide spectrum of fields, including bio-medical
imaging, microscopy, and genomics
\cite{Carpenter2006,Wolf2018,10.7717/peerj.453}
\cite{Segata2011,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695,HASHIMSHONY2012666,
  10.1093/bioinformatics/bts480,Carlile2014,Laganowsky2014,Jiangaac9462,
  10.3389/fninf.2014.00014}.  Our user base continues to grow as
Python is adopted by more scientists in the life sciences.  However,
given the scale and scope of the project, we are at the limit of what
can be developed and maintained with primarily volunteer effort. This
proposal identifies three key areas where we need sustained support to
ensure the health of the platform and provide the leadership to meet
the visualization challenges of the next 16 years:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item Maintenance of the library by curating existing and new Issues
    and Pull Requests.
  \item Developing a comprehensive plan to evolve the core Architecture
    of Matplotlib
  \item Developing the tools, documentation, and community to support
    a rich eco-system of domain specific plotting tools built on top
    of Matplotlib.
\end{enumerate}

We propose to fund Thomas Caswell (PI) for 6 months, Hannah Aizenman
for 12 months, and a third yet-identified software engineer for 12
Months to work on these tasks.  Caswell is the lead developer of
Matplotlib and an Associate Computational Scientist at Brookhaven
National Laboratory.  Aizenman is a core-contributor to Matplotlib,
who has previously worked on datatypes and outreach, and a PhD student
in computer science studying visualization at The City College of New
York.


\section{Goals}
\subsection{Curating Pull Requests and Issues}

The rate at which new Issues and Pull Requests come into the project
is out-pacing the rate at which volunteer effort can review them.
Over the past few years we have continued to merge PRs and close
issues about about [X per month], however new issues and PRs are opened
at a rate of [Y per month] which has produced a significant backlog.
This has resulted in useful contributions languishing in un-merged PRs
and bugs that break downstream packages going un-addressed.  This has
a deleterious effect on our community, discouraging new contributors,
and making it challenging to develop new contributors to the level of
familiarity with the code that they are able to review PRs. This leads
to an obvious negative feedback loop, where the community does not
grow in a healthy and sustainable manner.

The developer time asked for here will partly go towards active and
sustained curation of issues and pull requests.  A small team working
at least half time on Matplotlib maintenance we can ensure that :

\begin{itemize}
\item Old issues are dealt with and new issues receive quick
  engagement.  Issues need to be sorted in terms of how critical
  and how difficult they are to fix.
\item New contributors are effectively on-boarded to the project team.
\item Backward compatibility is maintained as much as practical.  If
  we do break API it should be intentional and well documented.
\item Group decisions about implemented proposed enhancements and features
  or breaking API are well managed.
\end{itemize}

None of this is to demote the importance of the volunteer
contributors, but will lead to a better co-ordination and nurturing of
their efforts, with the goal of growing and sustaining a diverse
community of expert contributors.  This community will continue to
sustain the project in the future.

\subsection{Road-map and Architecture Design}

The current architecture of Matplotlib was first designed 15 years ago
\cite{Hunter:2007}.  That it is still in use and alive is a testament
to its initial design, however it does not reflect all of the
developments in thinking around data structures, software design, and
visualization of the past decade.  Matplotlib does not natively know
how to exploit structured data (e.g. \texttt{pandas} or
\texttt{xarray}) objects or to seamlessly handle streaming data.  We
will look at how to update Matplotlib's internal data model to
leverage the information embedded in structured data.  While there are
downstream domain specific libraries that are built on top of
Matplotlib, interoperability between core Matplotlib and each other
can be fraught.  We will develop plans of how to re-factor the core
library to allow easy extension and smooth interoperability between
the core library and mutually between the domain specific plotting
tools.

In both cases we will develop clear requirement documents, document
critical use cases, and implement prototypes of the features and APIs.


\subsubsection{Data Model}

``Structured data'' combines one or more arrays into an object that
also contains labels, dimensions, and co-ordinates of the data (i.e. a
map of global surface temperatures containing $T$ , $latitude$ and
$longitude$ being packed together in an object along with all the
relevant meta data).  In addition to the data itself, these objects
also carry information about the relationship between the sub-parts.
Currently Matplotlib asks the users or downstream libraries to split
this information into its components and pass them individually to
plotting methods, losing the structure and relation ships.
Internally, each plotting method (and the objects used to represent
the plots, \texttt{Artist}s in the jargon) each handle normalizing and
storing user data independently.  This means that some common
functionality, such as handling data with attached units (i.e. degrees
Celsius) and ensuring that all data cast to numpy arrays, is scattered
through out the code base.  This leads to inconsistencies in the
behavior across the library and makes it difficult to write code that
updates the user data displayed that works across all types of plots.


Here we propose to put significant effort into re-designing the data
model for Matplotlib, and take steps towards implementing it.  The
goal is to have a simple model appropriate for the base Matplotlib
library and, more importantly, to have the technical underpinning in
place that will allow domain-specific downstream libraries be able to
handle structured or streamed data in a coherent fashion.  By removing
the direct data storage from the \tetxttt{Artist}s and defining an API
for data objects we will make easy to
\begin{itemize}
  \item smart up/down sampling of plotted data based on view limits
  \item seamlessly handling user-updated data, either streaming or
  \item backing the plot with non-numpy arrays, including queries to a
    database
\end{itemize}
All of these are currently \textit{technically} possible, they require
a significant amount of customization and do not readily generalize.
By defining a clear API to access data we will be able to de-couple the
development of the data storage and the \texttt{Artist}s.


\subsubsection{Rich \texttt{Artist}s}

\subsubsection{Homogenization of the API}

The library has grown organically over time through the contributions
of many people (800-900 individuals) and the code has accumulated many
small inconsistencies between different parts with slightly different
argument order (ex \texttt{ax.text(x, y, s)} vs
\texttt{ax.annotation(s, (x, y))}) or spelling/pluralization of
argument names. These subtle issues add friction for users, but are
not easy to fix.  To bring all of the APIs into harmony requires
knowing what \textbf{all} of the APIs are which requires dedicated
effort.  However, the biggest problem to harmonizing our APIs and
getting to ``one obvious way to do things'' is that due to our large
user base any API changes can have major negative impacts.  The
combination of these three things has left us in a bind, very similar
to numpy, where the burden of back compatibility is a significant
constraint on future progress.  Understanding all of these consequences
and mitigating them requires significant engineering effort and
absorbs much of the available volunteer developer effort.

\subsubsection{new visitor patterns}

\begin{itemize}
\item currently have 'draw' which takes in a canvas and render's itself
\item add 'export' which will provide a high-level json-like (use to
  implement non-pickle save/restore, export to {bokeh, plotly,
    qtplotting})
\item add a lower-level scene-graph like representation (suitable to push to a GPU?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coordination with downstream projects}

Much of the domain-specific specialization is carried in the semantics
of the structured data, so even once core Matplotlib can handle structured
data natively, there will still be a need for

Downstream libraries can provide any or all of tuned user-facing
functions, tuned artists, or a tuned data layer.

We will have to engage with current down stream projects to make sure
that our plans actually to make things easier for them.


\section{Work Plan}

The funds will be paid to:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fund Thomas Caswell's position for 6 months.  Caswell is
  currently the lead developer of Matplotlib.  His long-term
  experience, API design expertise, and project leadership are critical
  to the success of the work in this proposal.
\item Fund Hannah Aizenman's position for 12 months.  Aizenman has
  been a core-contributor Matplotlib for three years and has
  previously contributed support for string-categorical values.  Her
  work on the design of Matplotlib will be the basis of her PhD
  thesis.  Aizenman will take the lead on new-contributor on-boarding.
\item Fund 12 months of a yet-to-be identified software engineer to
  support all aspects of the proposal.  This may also cover travel to
  NYC for meetings if the third developer is remote.
\item Travel to key Scientific and Python conferences (such as SciPy
  or PyCon)
\end{itemize}

We want to use this dedicated effort to leverage and empower the
Matplotlib developer community.  In terms of direct work on the code
base an equal amount of time will be spent mentoring and reviewing
code from community members rather than directly implementing features
or fixing bugs.  All of the design work will be done in public with
input from the community.

Part of this work is to develop the project road-map.
