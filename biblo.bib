                  species is reflected in patterns of genetic
                  variation within and among populations. We developed
                  an efficient method for calculating the expected
                  distribution of genetic variation, given a
                  demographic model including such events as
                  population size changes, population splits and
                  joins, and migration. We applied our approach to
                  publicly available human sequencing data, searching
                  for models that best reproduce the observed
                  patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African,
                  European, and Asian populations yielded new dates
                  for when these populations diverged. In particular,
                  we found that African and Eurasian populations
                  diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier
                  than other genetic studies suggest, because our
                  model includes the effects of migration, which we
                  found to be important for reproducing observed
                  patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed
                  data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations
                  to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find
                  no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian
                  and Native American populations diverged. Our
                  methods are not limited to studying humans, and we
                  hope that future sequencing projects will offer more
                  insights into the history of both our own species
                  and others.},

                  yet its efficient application to single cells is
                  challenged by the small starting amounts of RNA. We
                  have developed CEL-Seq, a method for overcoming this
                  limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before
                  linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one round
                  of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq
                  gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive
                  results than a PCR-based amplification method. We
                  demonstrate the power of this method by studying
                  early C. elegans embryonic development at
                  single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of
                  transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as
                  the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in
                  the somatic cell lineages is enriched for
                  transcription factors. The robust transcriptome
                  quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will be useful
                  for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues

                  p. 10.1126/science.aac9462INTRODUCTIONThe intricate
                  microcircuitry of the cerebral cortex is thought to
                  be a critical substrate from which arise the
                  impressive capabilities of the mammalian
                  brain. Until now, our knowledge of the stereotypical
                  connectivity in neocortical microcircuits has been
                  pieced together from individual studies of the
                  connectivity between small numbers of neuronal cell
                  types. Here, we provide unbiased, large-scale
                  profiling of neuronal cell types and connections to
                  reveal the essential building blocks of the cortex
                  and the principles governing their assembly into
                  cortical circuits. Using advanced techniques for
                  tissue slicing, multiple simultaneous whole-cell
                  recording, and morphological reconstruction, we are
                  able to provide a comprehensive view of the
                  connectivity between diverse types of neurons,
                  particularly among types of γ-aminobutyric
                  acid{\textendash}releasing (GABAergic) interneurons,
                  in the adult animal.RATIONALEWe took advantage of a
                  method for preparing high-quality slices of adult
                  tissue and combined this technique with octuple
                  simultaneous, whole-cell recordings followed by an
                  improved staining method that allowed detailed
                  recovery of axonal and dendritic arbor
                  morphology. These data allowed us to perform a
                  census of morphologically and electrophysiologically
                  defined neuronal types (primarily GABAergic
                  interneurons) in neocortical layers 1, 2/3, and 5
                  (L1, L23, and L5, respectively) and to observe their
                  connectivity patterns in adult animals.RESULTSOur
                  large-scale, comprehensive profiling of neocortical
                  neurons differentiated 15 major types of
                  interneurons, in addition to two lamina-defined
                  types of pyramidal neurons (L23 and L5). Cortical
                  interneurons comprise two types in L1 (eNGC and
                  SBC-like), seven in L23 (L23MC, L23NGC, BTC, BPC,

                  L5BC, SC, HEC, and DC) (see the figure). Each type
                  has stereotypical electrophysiological properties
                  and morphological features and can be differentiated
                  from all others by cell type{\textendash}specific
                  axonal geometry and axonal projection
                  patterns. Importantly, each type of neuron has its
                  own characteristic input-output connectivity
                  profile, connecting with other constituent neuronal
                  types with varying degrees of specificity in
                  postsynaptic targets, laminar location, and synaptic
                  characteristics. Despite specific connection
                  patterns for each cell type, we found that a small
                  number of simple connectivity motifs are repeated
                  across layers and cell types defining a canonical
                  cortical microcircuit.CONCLUSIONOur comprehensive
                  profiling of neuronal cell types and connections in
                  adult neocortex provides the most complete wiring
                  diagram of neocortical microcircuits to
                  date. Compared with current genetic labels for cell
                  class, which paint the cortex in broad strokes, our
                  analysis of morphological and electrophysiological
                  properties revealed new cell classes and allowed us
                  to derive a small number of simple connectivity
                  rules that were repeated across layers and cell
                  types. This detailed blueprint of cortical wiring
                  should aid efforts to identify specific circuit
                  abnormalities in animal models of brain disease and
                  may eventually provide a path toward the development
                  of comprehensive circuit-based, cell

                  y Cajal in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
                  neuroscientists have speculated that a complete
                  understanding of neuronal cell types and their
                  connections is key to explaining complex brain
                  functions. However, a complete census of the
                  constituent cell types and their wiring diagram in
                  mature neocortex remains elusive. By combining
                  octuple whole-cell recordings with an optimized
                  avidin-biotin-peroxidase staining technique, we
                  carried out a morphological and electrophysiological
                  census of neuronal types in layers 1, 2/3, and 5 of
                  mature neocortex and mapped the connectivity between
                  more than 11,000 pairs of identified neurons. We
                  categorized 15 types of interneurons, and each
                  exhibited a characteristic pattern of connectivity
                  with other interneuron types and pyramidal
                  cells. The essential connectivity structure of the
                  neocortical microcircuit could be captured by only a
                  few connectivity motifs.},

  ABSTRACT =     {Statistical machine learning methods are
                  increasingly used for neuroimaging data
                  analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to
                  model high-dimensional datasets, e.g. multivariate
                  analysis of activation images or resting-state time
                  series. Supervised learning is typically used in
                  decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images
                  to behavioral or clinical observations, while
                  unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures
                  in sets of images (e.g. resting state functional
                  MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By
                  considering different functional neuroimaging
                  applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a
                  Python machine learning library, can be used to
                  perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn
                  contains a very large set of statistical learning
                  algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and
                  its application to neuroimaging data provides a
                  versatile tool to study the brain.}
